Stata help
***************
  
As we go through the semester, you will slowly but surely become familiar with Stata. Here are some
excellent starting points to help you.

*   :download:`Stata tutorial associated with the Stock and Watson textbook <./_static/stata_tutorial_10.pdf>`
    
    Although this is for Stata version 10 (a bit older than on ANU computers), this tutorial is
    still very relevant and helpful.

*   The Social Science Computing Cooperative at the University of Wisconsin provides excellent
    support for Stata beginners. Check out their website "Stata for Students":
        
    <http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/stata_students1.htm>

    Also, check out their website "Stata for Researchers":
        
    <http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/sfr-intro.htm>

    This website should be your first port of call in all things Stata.

*   Furthermore, the UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education provides fantastic resources
    for people who are interested in learning Stata:
