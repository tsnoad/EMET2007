Read this entire course outline carefully! 

Any items, rules, requirements in this course outline may be subject to changes. When this happens I
will announce it during the lecture. Announcements in the lecture supersede any information
contained in this course outline.


Course Description 
========================

This course provides an introduction to econometric methods and their applications. The main
workhorse of applied econometrics is the linear regression model and the course will develop its
theory and look at a wide range of applications.  The course emphasizes intuitive and conceptual
understanding as well as hands on econometric analysis using modern computer software on data sets
from economics and business. Students learn how to conduct empirical studies, as well as how to
analyze and interpret results from other empirical works. We cover a broad range of topics,
including: brief review of basic statistics; ordinary least squares estimation and its properties;
choice of functional form; departures from standard OLS assumptions; time series analysis. 

This is a hand-on course with a focus on applications in economics as well as business. A standard
statistical software will be used during computer sessions, no special programming skills are
required.

Prerequisites
---------------

To enroll in this course you must have completed EMET1001 *Foundations of Economic and Financial
Models* and STAT1008 *Quantitative Research Methods*, or STAT2001 *Introductory Mathematical Statistics*,
and ECON1101 *Microeconomics 1*. 



Communication 
---------------

.. important:: The official website for this course is 
   
   <http://EMET2007.Readthedocs.org>

I will frequently make announcements on the homepage of the Course Website (under "Announcements").

The official forum for announcements of any kind are the lectures. If necessary, I will contact
students electronically using their official ANU student e-mail address. If you want to contact me
send an e-mail to ::

    juergen.meinecke@anu.edu.au

E-mail addresses are only to be used when you need to contact staff about administrative or academic
matters. They are NOT to be used for instructional purposes. 

Textbook 
----------------------------

The textbook for the course is *Introduction to Econometrics* (third edition, 2012) by Stock and
Watson. Chiefly library has several copies of the textbook. I strongly recommend that you buy a
copy of the book as I base the lecture and practice sessions on it. 

Other excellent textbooks include *A Guide to Modern Econometrics* by Verbeek and *Introductory
Econometrics: A Modern Approach* 5ed, by Wooldridge.

Software
------------

The econometric software for this course is "Stata". Here's a quick wiki summary of what Stata is:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata>. From my own experience, Stata is an exhaustive,
well-documented, powerful and user-friendly statistical software. We will get to know Stata during
the tutorial in a "learning-by-doing manner".

Lectures 
-----------

There will be a two hour lecture each week. You are encouraged to attend all lectures. Lectures will
be held in the following venues at the following times:

=============== ========================================== 
Day             Tuesday         
=============== ==========================================
Type            Lecture         
Time            14-16           
Location        R N Robertson Lecture theatre (46e)     
=============== ========================================== 

If you have persistent time conflicts with any of these class sessions, you should not be taking the
course. Although content will be made available digitally (for example through audio recordings) you
should not treat virtual attendance as a perfect substitute for physical attendance. 



Tutorials
-------------------

In addition to lectures, you are expected to attend and actively participate in weekly tutorials
(weeks 2 through 13). Tutes are an integral part of this course. During each tute, your tutor will
develop and present solutions to selected exercises *in cooperation* with students. Solutions will
not be made available in any other form.

Allocation to tutorial groups will be made via the ETA (Electronic Tutorial Administration) system
which you can find following this `link <http://eta.fec.anu.edu.au/>`_. 


Digital Lecture Delivery
--------------------------

Audio recordings of the Tuesday lecture will be made available on Wattle. 

The tutorial sessions will not be made available on Wattle (they are group learning sessions and as
such do not lend themselves to audio recordings).


Workload
--------------------------

University study requires at least as much time and effort as a full--time job. You are expected to
attend all lectures and tutorials (3 hours per week). You should expect to put in at least 7 hours
per week of your own study time for this course in addition to the 3 hours of lectures and
tutorials.

===============================    ==================      ==========

Note, the midterm and final exams are **compulsory**. If you miss any exam without approval by the
School or College, you will fail the entire course!


Assignments 
------------ 

Working through exercises is an effective method of learning econometrics, as it is with most
mathematical subjects. That means that the assignments are more than simply part of the assessment
for the course. Students will be required to submit two written assignments during the semester.

The assignments will require computer work as well as analytical work. These assignments should be
your own work. You may discuss assignments with classmates, but you should do all your own
computing and writing of the assignments. It is an offense against the University’s regulations to
copy from other students’ assignments.  

Assignments should be submitted by dropping them into a specially labeled assignment box at the
Research School of Economics. (Contact the Course Administrator for details.) The front page of the
submitted assignments must show your name, student number and the course name (EMET2007).
Assignments missing any of this information will receive a mark of zero.  

Assignments must be submitted by 2pm on the due date. Important notice: late assignments are not
accepted under any circumstances. If you submit your assignment after 2pm on the due date and you do
not have a university approved excuse, you will receive a mark of zero on that assignment.  If you
have a university approved excuse for not handing in an assignment, then the value of the final exam
will be increased by 10 percentage points to compensate for the missed work.  

Further details about assignment submission will be given during lectures.


Midterm Examination
--------------------------

The midterm examination will be held during lecture time on Tuesday of week 7. The exam covers all
material from weeks 1 through 6 of the course (including the tutes). The exam will be marked out of
100. It is your responsibility to make yourself available for the midterm examination.

No make-up midterm examination will be offered. Should you miss the midterm exam for a valid reason
(see Rules and Policies below) then your final exam will be used to make up for the missed midterm
exam.

Final Examination
--------------------------

Examinable material covers the whole semester, including material already covered in the midterm
exam. The exam will be marked out of 100.

The final exam will be held in the exam period at the end of the semester. Details will be posted on
the ANU exam timetable site. 


Tutorial Participation
----------------------------------

Your participation is an essential part in the overall learning experience (both for you as well as
your classmates!) in the course. I will evaluate you on your participation during the tutorial
sessions. Feel free to participate and contribute to these sessions. Do not be afraid to give
`wrong` answers; as long as you are constructively engaged, there is no such thing as a wrong
answer. 

After every tutorial your tutor will take note of students who participated in class and at the end
of the semester I will aggregate these numbers to an overall participation mark. Roughly, I will
give 10 marks to regular participators, 5 marks to occasional participators and zero marks to
students who rarely or never participate. Feel free to seek feedback from me or your tutor during
the semester on your participation performance.


Scaling of Grades
--------------------

Final scores for the course will be determined by scaling the raw score totals to fit a sensible
distribution of grades. Scaling can increase or decrease a mark but does not change the order of
marks relative to the other students in the course. If it is decided that scaling is appropriate,
then the final mark awarded in a course may differ from the aggregation of the raw marks of each
assessment component.


Rules and Policies
============================

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations and the policies
and procedures that are relevant to your studies at the ANU. 

ANU has educational policies, procedures and guidelines, which are designed to ensure that staff and
students are aware of the University's academic standards, and implement them. You can find the
University's education policies and an explanatory glossary at: `ANU Policies
<http://policies.anu.edu.au/ Students>`_.

Students are expected to have read the `Student Academic Integrity Policy
<http://policies.anu.edu.au/ppl/document/ANUP_000392>`_ before the commencement of their course.  

Other key policies include: 

* Student Assessment (Coursework) 
  
* Student Surveys and Evaluations

The University also offers a number of support services for students. Information on these is available
online from `ANU Studentlife <http://students.anu.edu.au/studentlife/>`_.
