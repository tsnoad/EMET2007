Computer Tutorials
********************

.. note:: 
   
    Answers to exercises will only be provided during class time. If you cannot make it to class,
    you will need to see me during consultation times and we will work through the exercises
    together. (When you see me during consultation times, I expect you to be prepared. I will never
    merely provide answers to exercises. Instead, I want to see good faith effort on your part in
    which case I will be more than happy to help you work throught the exercises.)
